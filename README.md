# Important-coding-topics
It includes almost all basic topics of coding in C/C++

## Binary Tree
### Full binary tree
A full Binary tree is a special type of binary tree in which every parent node/internal node has either two or no children.
### Perfect binary tree
A perfect binary tree is a type of binary tree in which every internal node has exactly two child nodes and all the leaf nodes are at the same level.
### Complete binary tree
A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which all the levels are completely filled except possibly the lowest one, which is filled from the left.
### Balanced binary tree
A balanced binary tree, also referred to as a height-balanced binary tree, is defined as a binary tree in which the height of the left and right subtree of any node differ by not more than 1.

## Linked list
A linked list data structure includes a series of connected nodes.Here, each node store the data and the address of the next node.

### applications:
-Dynamic memory allocation
-Implemented in stack and queue
-In undo functionality of softwares
-Hash tables, Graphs
